This program is a simple simulation of a remote control of a hoist. We have three files R, S and H:
R simulate the control interface,
S is the server,
H simulate the hoist behaviour.

The user has four possible commands to interact with the hoist, they are represented as integers:
0 = STOP, stops the hoist motion.
1 = UP, increases the position of the hoist.
2 = DOWN, decreases the position of the hoist.
3 = OFF, turns off the simulation.

Anytime the user can change the movement by pressing Ctrl+Z and giving a new command.

The server S allows the comminication between R and H, it receives commands from R via socket and sends it to H via unnamed pipe; S also receives feedback about the hoist position from H via a second unnamed pipe and sends this feedback to R via socket.

H is the hoist simulator: this is represented by a simple variable z that can increase or decrease. The position of the hoist can vary between 0 cm and 200 cm with a 5 cm/s velocity. The initial position of the hoist is fixed at 0 cm. If the hoist reaches the maximum or minimum values, the message "End run" is printed and the program forbids to continue in the same direction.
